## Purpose of the Project
Strava is a social media website for athletes, which allows users to track and share their workouts. One feature Strava has is the Strava Year In Sport, which collects and summarizes an athlete's activities for the past year. I liked how it is a neat way of sharing statistics like your total distance and elevation covered, but I noticed it was only available towards the end of the year. 

This app is designed to allow athletes to summarize their stats from any given timeframe, at any time of year.

## Features
- secure connection to user's Strava account data
- collect Strava activity data from a given time range
- view summaries of individual activities
- view summary of activity data from given time range
